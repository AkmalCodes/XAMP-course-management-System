# PHP-eskills-course-managements-system

This project is an assessment for myself to create a simple course management system, to allow
instructors trainers and students manage their courses by creating, deleteing, enrolling, etc...
everything course related.

# Goals of this system are as follows:
1. To provide a free community-based online learning service that offers up-to-date
courses to learn various topics.
2. To provide a user-friendly interface for students to browse and enroll in courses.
3. To enable students to track their enrolled courses, view their progress, and access
course materials.
4. To gather feedback from students about courses and instructors to improve the
learning experience.
5. To generate certificates of completion for students who successfully finish a course.
6. To ensure data security and privacy by implementing proper authentication and access
controls.
